    """
    Read the contents of a file at ``fname``, written either in pickle or binary
    format.
    Args:
        fname (str): Path to file on disk from which data will be read.
        format ({"pickle", "binary"}): Format of the data that was written to disk.
            If 'pickle', use ``pickle`` in python's stdlib; if 'binary', use
            the 3rd-party ``msgpack`` library.
            .. warning:: Docs written in pickle format were saved all together
               as a list, which means they're all loaded into memory at once
               before streaming one by one. Mind your RAM usage, especially when
               reading many docs!
            .. warning:: When writing docs in binary format, spaCy's built-in
               ``spacy.Doc.to_bytes()`` method is used, but when reading the data
               back in :func:`read_spacy_docs()`, experimental and *unofficial*
               work-arounds are used to allow for all the docs in ``data`` to be
               read from the same file. If spaCy changes, this code could break,
               so use this functionality at your own risk!
        lang (str or ``spacy.Language``): Already-instantiated ``spacy.Language``
            object, or the string name by which it can be loaded, used to process
            the docs written to disk at ``fname``. Note that this is only applicable
            when ``format="binary"``.
    Yields:
        ``spacy.Doc``: Next deserialized document.
    Raises:
        ValueError: if format is not "pickle" or "binary", or if ``lang`` is not
            provided when ``format="binary"``
